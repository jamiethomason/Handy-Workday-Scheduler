# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

[Click here for a link to the deployed site.](https://jamiethomason.github.io/Handy-Workday-Scheduler/)

Process:
1. Reviewed starter HTML and CSS code.
2. Created JS file.
3. Pseudo-coded HTML and JS.
4. Used Moment.js to add time to top of page. 
5. Created rows for time-block tasks. 
6. Began JS script to make site function

Still to be done:
1. Complete JS script so that tasks are color-coded by past, present, and future.
2. Save tasks to local Storage. 
3. Give user ability to delete tasks
4. Fix deployed Site (it is picking up the readME instead of the HTML)
